    <p>The wedding options we offer at A2f Pictures are designed to cater directly to your needs and wishes to make sure your day is captured exactly the way you want it. And with our approach, you will know exactly what you will be getting from us. Many wedding videographers give you pre-packaged options. Unfortunately they are often riddled with confusing phrasing and vague references to what you will actually be receiving. You may also be paying for options in these packages you donâ€™t want or need.</p>
    <p>At A2f Pictures we have developed a system where you build your own unique wedding package. We understand that this day is one of the most important days of your lives and that every wedding is different and distinctive, so we want to ensure that you are getting the exact video you will want to show family and friends for the rest of your lives.</p>
